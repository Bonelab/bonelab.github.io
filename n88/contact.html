<h3>Eric Nodwell</h3>

<br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="feature" src="images/PhotoEricBorder2.jpeg" /></p>

<p class="biography">Whatever Eric is currently working on, you can be sure it is at the intersection 
    of science, math and computers. Prior to Numerics88, he has been involved with are a diagnostic 
    system for identifying defaults in large power generators 
    based on the analysis of their magnetic field, software for the reconstruction of huge data sets 
    of CT data obtained at synchrotron facilities, and an automated control system for molecular beam 
    epitaxy, used for semiconductor crystal growth. Eric worked at one of the companies that pioneered 
    the use of graphics cards for numeric calculations (Acceleware). Eric has a MSc in applied physics 
    and an BSc in mathematics and physics.</p>
